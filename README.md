## Using the template

The structure, style and text and image content of the CV may all be customised by editing the files in `src/setup`.
Further instructions for doing so will be added as this repo is populated. 

The one exception to this is the title of the html document, which should be changed by modifying the `<title>` element in `src/index.html`.
